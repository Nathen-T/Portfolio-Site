### Prediction Customer Churn in a Telecommunication Company

My task was to develop a predictive model to identify 3000 customers most likely to churn for a major U.S. wireless telecommunications company. Additionally, I provided a non-technical description of the characteristics of customer churn that could help establish a proactive churn management program.
