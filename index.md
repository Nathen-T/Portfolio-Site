### Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecommunications Company

My task was to develop a predictive model to identify 3000 customers most likely to churn for a major U.S. wireless telecommunications company. Additionally, I provided a non-technical description of the characteristics of customer churn that could help establish a proactive churn management program.

I tested a variety of models including quardratic discriminant analysis, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors and classification trees. A logistic regression was chosen due to its high interpretability and accuracy.
